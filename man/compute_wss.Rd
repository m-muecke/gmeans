\description{
Compute Within-Cluster Sum of Squares
}
\details{
WSS is defined as \deqn{
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left\|x_{i} - \mu_{j(i)}\right\|^2
},
where \eqn{x_{i}} is a data point and \eqn{\mu_{j(i)}} is the centroid of the cluster
to which \eqn{x_{i}} is assigned. When new data is provided, the function predicts
the nearest cluster for each new observation and computes the WSS for these points
based on their predicted clusters.

\examples{
km <- kmeans(mtcars, 5)
compute_wss(km)
# or with new data
compute_wss(km, mtcars)
}
